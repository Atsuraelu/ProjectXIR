Game Engine File Import and Export Plugin for Blender

Inspired by SourceIO and the Xenoverse 2 Modding community.

NOTE: This project is currently being developed by only one individual who is self-taught in python. Please have patience.
 Also, I am open to any form of help or contribution so anything is appreciated!
